## Discovering Soil Moisture Flow Equation from Data via Sparse Regression


Public Datasets and Codes for Data-driven discovery of soil moisture flow governing equation: A sparse regression framework. Water Resources Research. 

## Requirements

- Python 3.6.13
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Tensorflow 1.14


## Datasets

See Data folder, details can be found in journal article. This dataset is generated by solving Richardson-Richards equation by Ross method.

## Codes

Use step1.py (finite methods for clean data and automatic differentiation methods for noisy data) to generate a candidate library, then input into step2 sparse regression.
